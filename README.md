# Neural-networks-Genetic-algorithm
 A  genetic algorithm for Flower Evolution from scratch. The goal is to simulate the evolution of a population of flowers over generations. The flowers will evolve based on fitness, which is determined by user interaction. Using the basic principles of genetic algorithms, including selection, crossover, and mutation.
